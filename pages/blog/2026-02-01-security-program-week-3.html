<h1 id="narative">Narative</h1>
<p>I ended getting sick this week, and still not feeling great today, so only have a little bit of time to get this rolling. Thank all that is good and holy for espresso :)</p>
<p>Diving right in, I've got a Raspberry Pi 4 model b, and I've had issues in the past with SD cards failing. This time around, I'd like to try booting from USB 3.0. So I do two things. I drop a well-thought out prompt into Opus 4.5 with Research enabled, and I start searching the web for quality resources. </p>
<p>An initial search I did during the week seemed to indicate that we have to modify the Raspberry Pi's firmware, so I'm bracing for a technical and tedious workload, since I want to do this right and not brick my device.</p>
<p>I started by digging through the official Raspberry Pi documentation as the most authoritative source, and also opened a few blog posts sorting by a combination of most recent and reputation of the sources.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html#installing-the-operating-system">"Getting Started" documentation</a> leans heavy into recommending SD card installs as the easiest and most approachable route; however, a screenshot of the recommended software, the official Raspberry Pi Imager software, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/images/imager/choose-storage.png?hash=1d81f704b4fef7dd5bc2b043c87a5202">shows an attached USB</a> as the destination to write the OS image. I decided to grab a copy of the latst version of the software and install it locally for a closer look. Figuring I didn't have much time today with not feeling well, I just went for it and had the software write a standard 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS image to my USB drive. I let it spin while I dug deeped into the documentation. Perfect is the enemy of good. At this stage, it's better to fire a few bullets and run a few tests to get some initial feedback right away, versus researching and understanding the entire domain and developing a "perfect" action plan. I knew this was a good direction becuase I already watched myself looking at the USB drive partitions using CLI tools, and while it's very interesting and I'd love to do a deep dive into firmware flashing and drive partitions, etc., I knew that wasn't the most direct line to my northstar goal for this project. 
- I should get the screenshot, or at the very least </p>
<p>What do you know? By the time I finised writing this last paragraph, the imaging software is already complete. Time to jam it into the Pi and see what feedback we get!</p>
<p>What do you know, again? It booted right up. On the one hand, I'm a bit sad there's not time to dig into firmware and drive partition analysis and debugging, but on the other hand, I'm one step closer to my project's primary goal with a lot less stress and effort than I was expecting. I'll take it!</p>
<h2 id="risk-analysis">Risk analysis</h2>
<p>The only consideration I want to take at this point is whether I invited any project risks by taking the route that I did. I'm going to say "no." I used the latest version of official software to write a bootable USB with an official and supported version of an OS designed for this exact type of machine. I didn't have to review any open source code or run any libraries from sources I wasn't 100% sure about. We should be in a pretty good place. I'm feeling confident. Let's keep moving.</p>
<h2 id="still-some-fun">Still Some Fun</h2>
<p>The good news was that Claude Opus had completed churning out it's report. So, while I wasn't going to validate every source, I still had a good time reading about a few things. It turns out that any firmware version about 2021 or later already has a boot order set that looks for a USB drive to boot from is an SD card is not present. The OS must update the firmware when it first runs, because my firmware version is from 2025, and I have not even had this Pi connected to the Internet in at least a couple years.</p>
<p>The guide from Opus also mentions some performance issues when using USB thumb drives, and I am definitely experiencing these. A lot of things seem snappy and quick once loaded, but there are definitely some hangs and delays. </p>
<h1 id="digging-in">Digging In</h1>
<p>I went through the settings of the OS just to see if anything stuck out. For some reason auto-login at boot was enabled for both the shell and GUI. Toggled that off, and rebooted to verify. </p>
<p>I was able to use the <code>raspi-config</code> tool to validate the boot order. It matched what Opus told me. I would like to come back and harden this machine and lock the boot security down, but that's not right now. Any of the options present allow an adversary with physical access to the Pi the ability to hijack the boot order.</p>
<p><img alt="pi-boot-options" src="../../public/blog-files/2026-02-01-security-program-week-3-files/pi-boot-options.png" /></p>
<p>As fun as it sounds, it's not going to be an appropriate use of time to get into firmware patching. I can also assess physical security of the device as well, such as using a locked server cabinet in addition to standard home security. </p>
<h2 id="net-connect">Net Connect</h2>
<p>The other step I was able to take this was to confirm SSH access. During the OS imaging step, there was an option to specify a public key for certificate-based authentication to the Pi - so I generated a key pair and plugged one in. Now that I'm booted, I set the IP addresses of my terminal machine and the Pi to an arbitrary private subnet, and made my terminal machine the gateway of the subnet. After connecting both Network Interface Cards (NIC)s with an Ethernet cable, I was able to connect via SSH and control the Pi through a Terminal process using the private key stored on my terminal machine. This will come in handy for remote administration over the local network. I made sure and set a passphrase on the private key so that it couldn't be used if it was ever stolen. 
- Is the gateway step really necessary?</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up</h2>
<p>Pretty good for just having a few hours to throw at the project. I'll be taking a break next week to coach at the <a href="https://spokanectf.github.io/">Spokane Cyber Cup</a>. It's a great event that my friend, <a href="https://maxwelldulin.com/Blog">Maxwell Dulin</a>, puts on every year. Teams from high schools and colleges all over the region come to compete, but for Maxwell his main goal with the event is to share knowledge with exposure to cyber security concepts and challenges. I'm lucky enough to be able to coach at the event, and I just want to say that I think it's super cool that Maxwell goes out of his way to bring this event to Spokane, a city with a lot of promise and sometimes a little less exposure to cyber security education events like this one. Thank you, Maxwell!</p>
