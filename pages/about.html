      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <h3 class="mono">whoami</h3>
      <p>I tend to describe myself in the following ways:</p>
      <p>Father, husband, technologist, casual philosopher, progressive, security enthusiast, eternal student, and servant leader.</p>
      <h3>Why this site?</h3>
      <p>Really, just to have a space to express myself. A home away from home. My own little corner of the Internet.</p>
      <h3>What are my goals? What is my personal mission statement?</h3> 
      <p>I want to learn. I want to grow. I want to discover and become the best version of myself. <br><br>
      I want to have an impact. I want to leave this place a little better than I found it. <br><br>
      I want my work to speak for me in ways that show I care about present and future outcomes, and that I take pride in my results. That I understood and considered deeply. <br><br>
      I want to continue breaking the generational curses that plagued me, and protect my children from them. Then, guide them in preserving these lessons for future generations. <br><br>
      Following this, I want to spread love and be a source for peace. Nothing is more precious than peace, I believe. I want to share any valuable knowledge and experience that I've accumulated with the world.</p>
