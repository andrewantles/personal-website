      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <h3 class="mono">whoami</h3>
      <p>I am any one or more of the following...:</p>
      <p>Father, husband, technologist, casual philosopher, progressive, security enthusiast, eternal student, and servant leader.</p>
      <h3>Why this site?</h3>
      <p>Really, just to have a space to express myself. A little home away from home. My own little corner of the Internet.</p>
      <h3>What about me, what are my goals?</h3> 
      <p>I want to have an impact. I want to work and contribute to high-functioning, well-managed teams/companies/groups. <br /><br />
      I want to learn. I want to grow. I want to discover and become the best version of myself. <br /><br />
      I want to break the generational curses that plagued me, and protect my children from them. Then, help them understand why we need to preserve these lessons for future generations. <br /><br />
      Following this, I want to spread love and be a source for peace. 'Maslow's hierarchy of needs' style. Nothing is more precious than peace, I believe. <br /><br />
      Also, I love technology and will have an impact there as well. Along the same lines as above.</p>
