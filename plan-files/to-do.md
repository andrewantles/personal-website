1. Build pipeline action items:
   1. `./plan-files/blog-build-code-review.md` - need to finalize these findings before first build
   1. Build out build script automated tests to confirm a majority of things run as expected.
   1. Blog posts do not have titles at the top - I want this in an h2 at the top, like "Blog" on the listing page, blog.html
   1. Expand build script to replace the rest of the JS components.
   
1. I want a dark-mode toggle in the top-right of the header

   1. Search bar at the top
   1. Tagging cloud, or at least clickable links that return list of blogs with tag, sorted by most recent
   1. Year > Month (# of posts) nav

1. There's some sort of issue with using embed html tags for my resume PDF. Looks like it doesn't render on Android phones. I need to look into this and find a more inclusive solution.

   1. style-considerations.md
   1. Bot mitigation, robots.txt
   1. Markdown parser/post deployment

1. I should go through the GitHub settings when I have time to understand all the different controls and make sure I'm using all the latest best practices.

# Backlog

1. I'd like to understand what seems to be a default GitHub Action that appears to come along standard with GitHub Pages usage. It would be interesting to understand what exactly this is doing and how it works. (Seems to use Jekyll.)
