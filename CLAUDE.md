I don't want anything "Google" on my site. No fonts, no scripts, no analytics. Nothing "Google".

Responsiveness is very important. This website should load pleasingly on all devices.

Accessability is at least as important as Responsiveness, probably moreso. Make sure to include all standard-practice accessibility patterns.

The blog should be modern, minimalist, and light-weight, in that we want to minimize frameworks and "gimmicks." Stick to solid content, as opposed to flashy visuals. Feel free to bring up opportunities where you see a chance to vastly increase the visual appeal and sophistication of the site for very low cost in terms of libraries and load times, taking into account maintenance and complexity and keeping these to an absolute minimum. Only the most drastic visual and sophistication gains for the most minimal maintenance and effort should be suggested.
