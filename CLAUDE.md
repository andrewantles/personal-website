I don't want anything "Google" on my site. No fonts, no scripts, no analytics. Nothing "Google".

Responsiveness is very important. This website should load pleasingly on all devices.

Accessability is at least as important as Responsiveness, probably moreso. Make sure to include all standard-practice accessibility patterns.

The blog should be modern, minimalist, and light-weight, in that we want to minimize frameworks and "gimmicks." Stick to solid content, as opposed to flashy visuals. Feel free to bring up opportunities where you see a chance to vastly increase the visual appeal and sophistication of the site for very low cost in terms of libraries and load times, taking into account maintenance and complexity and keeping these to an absolute minimum. Only the most drastic visual and sophistication gains for the most minimal maintenance and effort should be suggested. 

When suggesting and implementing changes, explain the elements in detail. I need to know what we're changing, how it works, why we're changing it, and the expected outcome. Assume that I am comfortable with programming and scripting in Python, but not spending as much time keeping up with-end programming and design principles.

Part of the purpose of this blog is for my own education and skill sharpening. I do not want to use Hugo or 11ty because I want the experience and understanding that comes with "rolling my own" components. Within reason. At some point it makes sense to use a framework, but I would prefer something like React because a) its prevalence and applicability of upskilling in it, and b) it's extremely well documented and I can dig in to references to understand. In other words, I don't want to "abstract away" the learning and hands-on aspect of managing a personal website.
